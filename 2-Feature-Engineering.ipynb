    "While this dataset contains some useful features in predicting game outcomes, there are some features that need to be created or extracted from the data before they can be used for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The features available in the dataset are 'SEASON_ID' 'TEAM_ID', 'TEAM_ABBREVIATION', 'TEAM_NAME', 'GAME_ID', 'GAME_DATE', 'MATCHUP', 'WL' (win/loss), 'MIN' (game length in minutes), 'PTS' (points scored by team), 'FGM' (field goal makes), 'FGA' (field goal attemps), 'FG_PCT' (field goal percentage), 'FG3M' (3-point makes), 'FG3A' (3-point attempts), 'FG3_PCT' (3-point percentage), 'FTM' (free throw makes), 'FTA' (free throw attemps), 'FT_PCT' (free throw percentage), 'OREB' (offensive rebounds), 'DREB' (defensive rebounds), 'REB' (total rebounds), 'AST' (assists), 'STL' (steals), 'BLK' (blocks), 'TOV' (turnovers), 'PF' (personal fouls), and 'PLUS_MINUS'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The point of this analysis is not to use current game statistics to predict the outcome of a game. For example, I would not want to use field goal attempts in the current game as an input into my model. Instead, I want my model to have information that is accessible before the start of the game, which includes contextual factors such as home/away and number of rest days, as well as statistics from previous games. For these purposes, I will be creating the below features:\n",
    "* 'win_lose_margin': Margin of victory or loss \n",
    "* 'home': Home/away binary feature\n",
    "* 'win': Win binary feature\n",
    "* 'matchup_ID': Unique identifier for matchup pairs\n",
    "* 'three_matchup_win_pct': Percent of games won by a team in the previous three matchups against the same opponent\n",
    "* 'rest_days': Number of rest days since last game\n",
    "* 'win_streak': Count of how many games in a row the team has won, resets to zero if they lost the last game \n",
    "* 'win_record', 'loss_record': Team's win and loss record for the season\n",
    "* 'season_win_pct': Percent of games a team has won so far this season\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I will create rolling averages for important team statistics. The rolling average is for the last 10 games a team played and is calculated for the following features: 'MIN', 'PTS', 'FGM', 'FGA', 'FG_PCT', 'FG3M', 'FG3A', 'FG3_PCT', 'FTM', 'FTA',m 'FT_PCT', 'OREB', 'DREB', 'REB', 'AST', 'STL', 'BLK', 'TOV', 'PF', 'PLUS_MINUS', 'win_lose_margin', 'win', 'home', and 'rest_days'.
