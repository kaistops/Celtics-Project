    "## Summary of Work\n",
    "\n",
    "As a passionate Boston Celtics fan, I have always been curious about the factors that contribute to a team's success in basketball. The Celtics are ranked #1 in the Eastern Conference as of early 2023, and most nights, they play with exactly the type of outstanding performance Boston sports fans come to expect from them. However, there are other nights where it's like watching a completely different and disjointed team on the court. What factors impact a team's performance on the court fromg game to game? With the help of box score data sourced from NBA.com and machine learning algorithms, I am setting out to build a model that can identify the most important factors and use them to accurately predict the outcome of NBA games. \n",
    "\n",
    "The National Basketball Association (NBA) was founded in 1946, making it one of the oldest professional sports leagues in North America. Over the years, the league has grown in size and popularity, and today it features 30 teams from across the United States and Canada. My research ino the NBA as well as my observations from being a fan have revealed that factors such as home-court advantage, number of rest days, and previous team performance can have predictive power in determining the outcome of a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some argue that the outcome of basketball is relatively easy to predict compared to other sports. The main argument is that basketball is a high-scoring sport, with teams scoring over 100 points per game on a regular basis. Thus, basketball is subject to less randomness than low-scoring sports like soccer or baseball, in which luck may play a larger role. Many NBA teams also feature star players who have a significant impact on the outcome of the game, which can make it easier to predict the winner based on the performance of those players. However, even the best teams and players have nights where they perform worse than expected, and factors that are harder to measure such as team chemistry and coaching strategy can play a significant role in determining the outcome of a game. At the end of the day, NBA players are humans subject to randomness in health, attitude, and performance game-to-game, which can make basketball outcomes tricky to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many websites and experts have attempted to predict NBA game outcomes with varying degrees of success. One notable example is FiveThirtyEight, which has built a reputation for using data and statistics to make predictions in various fields, including politics and sports. I will be using some of the methodology from FiveThirtyEight's ELO model in my analysis. The ELO Rating system was not founded by FiveThirtyEight, rather it was invented and used much earlier for predicting chess outcomes and later adapted to professional sports leagues such as the NBA and NFL. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ELO Rating system measures a team's relative strength throughout a season. Each team begins their first game (in my dataset, this would be the first game of the 2017-2018 season) with an ELO rating of 1500. After each game, the two teams who participated in the game exchange a certain number of points based on factors such as the winner, the margin of victory, and home court advantage, with more points being awarded for upsets where the underdog won the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the season is over, teams do not have a \"hard reset\" back to 1500 points for the beginning of the next season; rather they revert to the mean in a \"soft reset\". The Elo rating for the start of the next season is calculated as 75% of the team's Elo rating at the end of the previous season, plus 25% of the original Elo rating of 1500. The reason that the soft reset is desirable here is to account for the fact that not all teams are created equal, and good teams tend to stay good from season-to-season while bad teams tend to stay bad. Take the Golden State Warriors, for example, who pay a large amount of what is called 'luxury tax' to keep expensive players on their roster. Of course, factors such as trades in the offseason, player skill change, and new coaching can have a big impact on team performance, but to assume that all teams revert to being equal every season would be grossly incorrect."
